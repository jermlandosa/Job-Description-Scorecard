# LinkedIn Launch Content

## Short Launch Post
**Hook:**
> I keep seeing job descriptions that are walls of buzzwords and missing the basics.

**Copy:**
> I built a tiny tool that scores any JD 0–100 and tells you exactly what to fix — salary, EEO, apply path, readability, jargon, the works. It also generates a clean rewrite (rule-based, no AI, no data leaves your browser).
>
> Try it here: **[link]**
>
> If you post JDs, run your next one through this and tell me what broke. If you’re a candidate, paste the role you’re eyeing — you’ll see the red flags instantly.

## Longer Launch Post
**Lead:**
> Most JDs are hard to read and easy to ignore.

**Body:**
> I shipped a free **Job Description Scorecard**:
> • 0–100 score across clarity, structure, requirements realism, inclusivity, transparency, readability, jargon
> • Flags the big misses (salary range, location, EEO, apply steps)
> • One-click, rule-based rewrite — shorter sentences, fewer buzzwords, standard headings
> • **Local-only**: paste stays on your device
>
> It’s just a single static page. No accounts, no keys.
>
> 👉 **[Try it]** and drop feedback. I’ll tune the rubric if enough people want different weights.

**CTA Comment Suggestion:**
> Next up I’m building a Boston Biotech Event Map and a “Rate My Job Post” rubric you can customize. If you want an org-specific version (custom banned phrases, comp format, etc.), DM me.

## Engagement Snippets
**Comment Template:**
> Ran this through my JD Scorecard: **{X}/100** — Top fixes: {3 quick items}. Full tool (local-only) here: [link]. Happy to share the rewrite if helpful.

**DM Reply:**
> Appreciate you reaching out. I can ship a lightweight org-specific version (weights, banned phrases, comp/EEO templates) in a day. If you send 2–3 sample JDs, I’ll tailor the rubric and push a private page for your team to try.
